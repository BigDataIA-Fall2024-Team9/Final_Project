# Final Project - SmartLease: AI-Powered Apartment Search

# Background

The current landscape of online apartment hunting is often characterised by some complex and time consuming filtering processes. The Users typically navigate through multiple dropdown menus, checkboxes and sliders in order to specify their desired location, cost range, property type and amenities. This multi-step process can be frustrating, time consuming and inefficient, especially for those who have a clear idea of what they're looking for but struggle to translate it into the rigid structure of traditional search filters. So the need for a more intuitive AI backed approach to apartment searching has become increasingly apparent as renters seek faster, more efficient ways to find their ideal homes.

# Objective

The primary goal of this project is to revolutionize the apartment search experience by developing an advanced search platform that leverages Large Language Models. This system aims to allow users to input their requirements in a conversational, sentence-form manner, eliminating the need for manual filter selection.

By doing so, our project seeks to:

Simplify the search process, making it user-friendly.

Reduce the time and effort required to find suitable apartment listings.

Improve the accuracy of search results by better understanding user search.
